                <h3>Holocaust Definition</h3>
                <p>The Holocaust: The act of genocide carried out by the Nazis with the intention to exterminate all Jewish people in Europe.</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <h3>Genocide Definition</h3>
                <p>Genocide: The deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic or religious group with the intention of destroying that nation or group.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Characteristics of a genocide are a particular group is demonised and killed en masse, the group is forced to live in poor conditions, the group is prevented from giving birth and the children are forcibly removed from their families.</p>
            
            <p>Hitler believed that Jewish people were the reason that Germany lost World War One as they caused disruptions on the home front and that Jews were subhuman to the Aryan race of the German people. Hitler wrote a book called Mein Kampf which outlined his vision for Germany. This book called for Jewish people to be persecuted and expelled from Europe so he could make Germany strong through racial purity.</p>

            <p>Once in power in 1933, Hitler and the Nazis began making life difficult for Jews, homosexuals, homeless people, and disabled folks. They excluded them from public life, forbid relationships between Jews and German people, boycotted Jewish businesses, evicted them, and sent them to concentration camps, and executed them if they resisted.</p>

                <h2>Reader Questions: Eddie Jaku's "The Happiest Man on Earth"</h2>
                <p><em>Submitted by Tyler Russell, reader of The Best News</em></p>
                
                <div class="question">1. How does Jaku describe how the Nazis treated Jewish people at concentration camps?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Eddie Jaku describes the treatment as brutally inhumane. Jewish people were systematically dehumanized, subjected to extreme violence, forced labor, starvation, and arbitrary executions. The Nazis implemented a regime of terror designed to break both body and spirit.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">2. What phrase does he use to describe Auschwitz-Birkenau?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jaku refers to Auschwitz-Birkenau as the "factory of death" or "killing factory," emphasizing the industrialized, systematic nature of the mass murder that occurred there.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">3. What were the living conditions like at Auschwitz-Birkenau?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Living conditions were deliberately designed to be lethal. Prisoners faced extreme overcrowding in barracks, inadequate food leading to starvation, minimal sanitation causing disease, exposure to harsh weather with insufficient clothing, and constant physical and psychological abuse from guards.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">4. What does this source reveal about how the Nazis viewed Jewish people?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jaku's account demonstrates that the Nazis viewed Jewish people as subhuman - as Untermenschen in their racial ideology. This dehumanization was necessary to justify the systematic destruction of an entire people, allowing perpetrators to overcome normal moral restraints against mass murder.</p>
